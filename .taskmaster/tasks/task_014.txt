# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Scalability Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop features to support horizontal scaling and high concurrency.
# Details:
1. Implement stateless authentication for load balancing compatibility
2. Set up database sharding capabilities using MongoDB's native sharding
3. Implement connection pooling for database connections
4. Create a microservices architecture using Nest.js 10.0.0
